# Hi, I'm Sarthak! ðŸ‘‹
 
I have recently discovered a new low-code tool to convert your figma design into react, HTML/CSS, React Native, Gatsby, NextJs etc.
 
The amzaing tool name is "Locofy.ai". This is available in Figma as one such plugin. One can directly install them and it is so so easy to use.

## Description of the project
![hack logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78408749/188305435-6fd0d32c-7e29-40a8-9349-36e77bec5b3d.jpg)
 
This is my first UI/UX Project, made using tools like Figma, Locofy plugin and, React 18 with Typescript and CSS Modules.
 
As a frontend dev, I always wanted to work with figma and this chance is given to me by Locofy.ai. The Hackathon (Build faster like a Loco âš¡) has really helped me in converting the UI/UX design directly into react code. This is my first encounter with Locofy and the experience was really good.
